text=When you first open up Ender Mail, it'll ask you to register. So what you do is, you click the little button that says "Register" on it. After you done that, it'll ask you to choose your email. Here you just enter "FooBar", (if you want your email address to be FooBar@endermail.com). Once you've decided what email address you want to claim, you just click the button that says "Register" on it (not to be confused with the previous Register button).

#paragraph
text=The fourth button is the "Trash Email" button. This button is a little bit like a recycle bin, as it throws out the emails you have selected while clicking this button.

#paragraph
text=The second last button is the "Refresh Inbox" button. This button allows you to refresh your inbox, without re-opening the Ender Mail client. You can also spam this button, to be updated on new emails instantaneously as new emails come in.

#paragraph
text=The final button in the toolbar appears to be a wrench. We currently don't know what this mysterious button does. We can only assume that it is some kind of weapon. It may be used to slay monsters at night or to put nails in your wall. Just don't do that while your Mom is home, she might get mad at you for putting nails in the wall.
